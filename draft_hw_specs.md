Board's hardware specs
======================

+ Low-power MCU => Cortex M0+ looks to be a good candidate
	+ Low voltage operation?
+ USB port with UART and debugging session
+ Additional small debug port (No-mount or so)
+ Power :
	+ LiPo battery input
	+ USB
	+ Charge LiPo when connected to USB? (Nice to have)
+ Small size
	+ Adafruit Feather form factor?
+ 4x mounting holes
+ Interfaces:
	+ 1x UART
	+ 1x SPI
	+ 1x I2C
	+ ?x GPIOs
	+ 2x ADC?
